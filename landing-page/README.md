## Instructions

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Landing Page project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the Udacity Classroom.

From the beginning put all content into "ul" list and then build the navigation menu, link use section's ID attributes as links.

Have a problem with https://eslint.org/ I don't understand why it shows an error even on code like: 
const a = 12;

I tested on the browser shows no errors.

Have a problem hiding menu when no scrolling, I'm not sure that I placed it in right place. 
I need a review of my code to understand what I missed.
